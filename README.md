# weather_station_pi
Python Code for a homemade weather station on a raspberry pi 4.

Currently is built with a BME280 sensor to measure temperature, humidity and atmospheric pressure. 
And a adafruit anemometer with an analog voltage output, which is read using an ADS1015 analog to digital converter.

Data is storaged on a DB in the raspberry pi. Currently working to extract data to my personal laptop to create a dashboard and analyze the data.
